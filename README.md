Ronabot: A covid-19 informational chatbot for canadian residents

Abstract
The world at large has experienced a negatively disruptive shift since the advent of COVID-19 in 2020. Even more of a global pandemic than the virus itself is the fast spread of inaccurate information on the subject. Technology plays a major role in changing the narrative through various means and methods. A widely used technology for the purpose of providing and collecting information in recent years is the chatbot which provides information to users in a real-time conversation through chats. In this project, a chatbot called Ronabot has been developed based on information compiled from accurate and authentic sources to address inquiries on COVID-19 by Canadian Users. Given the potential of combating the pandemic through access to reliable information on COVID, Ronabot poses a promising and reliable assistant to residents of Canada in aiding prompt access to accurate answers on COVID-19 on demand.
